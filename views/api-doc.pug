  h2 API Documentation
  p
    | Leaders like me is a REST API (Application Programming Interface) created with the intention to give users resources for people who have contributed to society in innovative ways in the fields of STEAM and Social Justice. It was created by a teacher turned web developer who, when looking for anti-racist and inclusive exemplars for his lessons, had trouble finding resources. A survey was given to educators and people within the tech field to help populate the names in the database. This is, by no means, a finite resource, but merely a stepping stone to a bigger resource. The user can use the home page to populate a result inputting their own information, but there are other ways to get the data using the GET requests below.
